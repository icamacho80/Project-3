        <h1>Mapping Online US Electronics Sales</h1
        <p>Visualizing sales data and making informed decisions.</p>
    </br>
        <p>Coming up on holiday season 2024, we find ourselves entering the phase of the ever-repeating consumer cycle of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and other Holiday Deals. For our third project of this course, our team opted to take a closer look at online sales data across the US.
        Through deep examination, we've taken a look at data and trends in online shopping from accounts of thousands of individuals acrossthe US varying in gender, income, and age, while looking at other factors like brand preference, spending total per state, fluctuation in spending on seasons and more.
        By doing so, in this project we have analyzed potential trends in sales outcomes utilizing a public dataset showing purchase history of individuals who've shopped online between Amazon and other varying online department stores, from 2023- 2024.
        <br> Our goal in our examination of the data has been to gain insight into several key aspects of online sales, including:​
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Spending Trends and Monetary Insights</b> to identify where consumers are actively spending and the overall direction of sales momentum, as well as the average and total amounts consumers are spending across different segments.​
            <br>
            <b>Categories of Interest:</b> Understanding which product categories are driving the most consumer engagement and revenue.
            <br>
            <b>Geographic Preferences:</b> Exploring regional or location-based differences in purchasing habits.​
            <br>
            <b>Brand and Product Popularity:</b> Highlighting which specific products or brands are resonating most with consumers.​
            <br>
            <b>Consumerism Patterns:</b> Examining broader consumer behavior to determine how economic and social factors might be influencing purchasing decisions.​
            <br>
            <br>
            By diving into this data, we aim to provide actionable insights into what drives consumer purchases, the brands or products capturing the market’s attention, and how these trends might shape future sales strategies.</p>
